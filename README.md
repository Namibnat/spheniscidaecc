# Spheniscidae C Compiler

This project is a toy compiler project of mine.  I hope to 
get to the point where it can compile itself, but I'm not sure
I'll actually get that far.


## Build

Run make to build:

    make spheniscidaecc

This is just an interesting read, and a nice way to get a view of the
work ahead.

## Name

Spheniscidae is the family to which penguins belong.  I like penguins,
they are a hint at the fact that this is built on Linux ([Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
in my case), a hint to my love of nature, and, well, penguins are sort of funny and 
might wobble a bit...a bit like my compiler.  DON'T USE THIS COMPILER
FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN MESSING AROUND.

The 'cc' at the end stands for C compiler, of course.
